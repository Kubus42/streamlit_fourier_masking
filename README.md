# 2D Fourier Transform Masking App

This Streamlit app lets you explore 2D Fourier Transforms by applying various frequency-domain masks to images. You can view the Fourier magnitude spectrum and see the effect of different masks on the reconstructed image.

## Features:
- View and interact with the Fourier magnitude spectrum of images.
- Apply predefined or custom masks (Spokes, Spiral, Low/High Frequencies, Lines).
- Upload your own image or use default examples.

## Installation:

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fourier-transform-masking.git
   cd fourier-transform-masking
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Run the app:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
